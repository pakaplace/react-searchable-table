# Pair programming exercise: Reactive table

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to display tabular data interactively using React.

## Instructions

For this exercise you will have a single React component that renders the
whole page. Tomorrow we're going to learn how to split React applications
into components that talk to each other. We don't need that today.

### The view

There should be a single file picker on the page.
